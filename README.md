# 🖥️ Memory Allocation Simulator

A web-based simulator that demonstrates various **memory allocation techniques** such as **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit**. This project provides an interactive way to understand memory management concepts in operating systems.

## 🚀 Features

✅ First Fit Algorithm ➔ Allocates the first available block that fits the process size.  
✅ Best Fit Algorithm ➔ Allocates the smallest available block that fits the process size.  
✅ Worst Fit Algorithm ➔ Allocates the largest available block that fits the process size.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** ➔ Structure of the web page  
- **CSS3** ➔ Styling for the simulator  
- **JavaScript** ➔ Logic for memory allocation algorithms
